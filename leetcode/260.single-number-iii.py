# Testcase Example:  '[1,2,1,3,2,5]'
#
# Given an integer array nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once
# and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that
# appear only once. You can return the answer in any order.
#
# Follow up:Â Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you
# implement it using only constant space complexity?
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,2,5]
# Output: [3,5]
# Explanation:  [5, 3] is also a valid answer.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: nums = [-1,0]
# Output: [-1,0]
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: nums = [0,1]
# Output: [1,0]
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= nums.length <= 30000
# Each integer in nums will appear twice, only two integers will appear once.
#
