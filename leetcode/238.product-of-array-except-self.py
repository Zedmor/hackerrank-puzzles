# Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3,4]'
#
# Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1,  return an array output such
# that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except
# nums[i].
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input:  [1,2,3,4]
# Output: [24,12,8,6]
# 
# 
# Constraint: It's guaranteed that the product of the elements of any prefix or
# suffix of the array (including the whole array) fits in a 32 bit integer.
# 
# Note: Please solve it without division and in O(n).
# 
# Follow up:
# Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array does not
# count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)
#

class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
