#
# Given an array arr.Â  You can choose a set of integers and remove all the
# occurrences of these integers in the array.
#
# Return the minimum size of the set so that at least half of the integers of
# the array are removed.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: arr = [3,3,3,3,5,5,5,2,2,7]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: Choosing {3,7} will make the new array [5,5,5,2,2] which has
# size 5 (i.e equal to half of the size of the old array).
# Possible sets of size 2 are {3,5},{3,2},{5,2}.
# Choosing set {2,7} is not possible as it will make the new array
# [3,3,3,3,5,5,5] which has size greater than half of the size of the old
# array.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: arr = [7,7,7,7,7,7]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The only possible set you can choose is {7}. This will make the
# new array empty.
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: arr = [1,9]
# Output: 1
#
#
# Example 4:
#
#
# Input: arr = [1000,1000,3,7]
# Output: 1
#
#
# Example 5:
#
#
# Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
# Output: 5
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= arr.length <= 10^5
# arr.length is even.
# 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^5
#
