#
# Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, find
# the length of shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord,
# such that:
#
#
# Only one letter can be changed at a time.
# Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that beginWord is not
# a transformed word.
#
#
# Note:
#
#
# Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
# All words have the same length.
# All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
# You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
# You may assume beginWord and endWord are non-empty and are not the same.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input:
# beginWord = "hit",
# endWord = "cog",
# wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
#
# Output: 5

"""
>>> Solution().ladderLength("hit", "cog", ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"])
5

>>> Solution().ladderLength("hit", "cog", ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"])
0
"""
#
# Explanation: As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" ->
# "dog" -> "cog",
# return its length 5.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input:
# beginWord = "hit"
# endWord = "cog"
# wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
#
# Output: 0
#
# Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible
# transformation.
