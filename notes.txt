a. Review trends in algorithm(s) performance to see at which point making trades becomes +ev
    (a) Note that different models may do better at different parts of the game
    (b) At later part of the game maybe good idea to ensemble several models / maybe ensemble is best all the time???
2. Choose the strategy - what algorithm / ensemble and when do we start trading etc.

1. Run the chosen strategy on historical data to see what happens (should do very well here since we are probably cheating on start)

1. Submit and see how chosen strategy does on hidden data sets

Note the main trade off in this game is start trading early vs. wait for more info - keep in mind bankroll is compounding
    This is kinda of like playing a strategy game - build city vs. built units to expand early - need to strike a balance
